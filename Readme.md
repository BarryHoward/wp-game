# Game Project Bonus Assignment (WORK IN PROGRESS)

[deployed to surge](http://tiy-barryhoward-wp-game.surge.sh/)

After completing the gilded rose weekened assignment, I began creating a game for bonus work.  I continued working on this as long as I had free time, but eventually I had to refocus when hackathon and final project work began, leaving the game unfinished.

The game is a standard turn-based RPG constructured using JQuery and a basic MVC framework.  Currently the styling isn't completed as is a lot of functionality, but it is still somewhat playable.  The Move order is to the right, with each players turn being listed out based on their speed, etc.  Any actions performed by players are listed at the top, while the controls are listed at the bottom.  After each action, the player must click to progress to the next screen.
